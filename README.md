### **Room Rent Limit**
- You might prefer a room that costs 10,000 INR per day, but few plans have a room rent limit e.g. 5000 INR per day.
- It's better to choose a plan that allows you to pick any room of your choice at the time of hospitalization (Without any room rent limit)

### **Restoration of Cover**
- Let's suppose you purchased a policy of 5L Sum Insured, and in the same year, you end up using the entire amount.
- The amount of 5L can be restored to you to use again in the same year.
- Insurer restores the sum assured to provide continued coverage to policyholders.

### **Renewal Bonus | No Claim Bonus**
- It's a discount on your premium offered by the insurance company for every claim-free year.
- So, if you don't make any claims during a policy year, you'll get a discount on your premium when you renew the policy.
- The discount typically increases with each claim-free year, up to a certain limit (often 50%).

### **Cashless Hospitals**
- Healthcare facilities that have tie-ups with your health insurance provider.
- This allows you to avail medical treatment at the hospital without having to pay the bill upfront.
- Pre-authorization: Before undergoing treatment, you or the hospital will contact your insurance company to get approval for cashless treatment.
- This involves verifying if your policy covers the planned treatment and checking if you've exhausted your deductible (if applicable).
- Settling the Bill: Once approved, the hospital will directly bill your insurance company for the covered expenses.
- You might still be responsible for any co-pay or any charges exceeding the sum insured in your policy.

**Benefits of Cashless Hospitals:**
- Convenience: You don't need to worry about arranging a large sum of money upfront for treatment.
- Faster Treatment: The pre-approval process helps avoid delays in starting treatment.
- Transparency: The hospital and insurance company handle the billing directly, minimizing confusion.

### **Co-pay | Copayment**
- On hospitalization, some plans may require you to pay a certain percentage of your bill.
- Look for **no copay** or **zero copay** (0%) plans while buying health insurance.

### **Pre/Post Hospitalization**
- Anyone who gets hospitalized has to go through lot of checkups, lab tests, and medicines before admission or after discharge.
- All these expenses can be claimed/covered by the health insurance plan.
- Always choose a plan with the maximum window of pre (60 Days) and post (180 Days) hospitalization.

### **Day Care Treatment**
- Medical procedures that require hospitalization for a short duration, typically less than 24 hours.
- Select the plans that cover this feature. Any hospitalization for more than 2 hours can be covered.
